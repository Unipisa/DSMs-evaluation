# A comparative evaluation and analysis of three generations of Distributional Semantic Models

In this repository, we provide the code and Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) for a large-scale evaluation of type distributional vectors, either produced by static DSMs or obtained by averaging the contextualized vectors generated by BERT. 

These scripts offer a useful instrument to investigate the performance of embeddings in several semantic tasks, carrying out an in-depth statistical analysis to identify the major factors influencing the behavior of DSMs. 

This analysis is composed of an intrinsic evaluation, an extrinsic evaluation, and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), a methodology borrowed from cognitive science to inspect the semantic spaces generated by distributional models.
